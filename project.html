										<h3>Problematic</h3>
									<p> 75% of farmers in Colombia earn under the minimum wage, generating a
										low-life quality standard, particularly in rural areas, leading to a migratory process of these
										farmers towards the city and creating a decrease in job opportunities and more unemployed
										holders. It is also highlighted that 40% of the monthly family shopping basket comes from
										farmers.
										Secondly, there are high manufacturing costs for producing organic products. Moreover, people are not usually
										willing to pay for them at a fair price.
										Finally, from the 21 million potential lands for viable organic production, 1) only
										0.25% of it (54,000 hectares) are effectively agricultural dedicated and chemical free . Since
										nowadays there's an abundance of agrochemicals such as pesticides, fertilizers, and
										biochemicals for pests control, which lead to the pollution of water-supply sources and natural
										ecosystems that feed most of the food supply chain that we usually buy through intermediaries.</p>

										<h2>Why in the department of Cauca?</h2>
										<p>Although Cauca has been one of the most affected departments at a national level by violence caused by insurgent groups, drug traffickers and corrupt politicians, it has best managed to replace all of its effects. This department has the characteristic of having great wealth in all of its sectors including the economic, cultural and environmental ones. The city of Popayán, capital of the department of Cauca with a growth population of 10%, has been gaining recognition among Colombian visitors from abroad, not only for its religious traditions such as Holy Week and its Gastronomic Congress, but for it is the entrance to different tourist sites such as the National Archaeological Park from Tierradentro, National Park of Puracé and Historic Center of Popayán.

											<p>Some of the existing traditions in our department, we have: Holy Week, the gastronomic congress, the festival of blacks and whites. Also, it is necessary to consolidate economic sustainability processes that allow the improvement of the quality of life of existing populations and future generations, especially the most vulnerable, through cultural and nature community tourism, as a fundamental strategy for the responsible empowerment of the territory, based on the rescue of traditions, ancestral knowledge, the conservation of the environment, from the legacy to the new generations, in order for them to maintain them, appropriate them, and through them undertake life projects and can proudly show it to the visitors of the department..</p>

											<p>According to the DANE projections as of the 2005 census, the population of the department has presented an average growth rate of 0.89%, where 20% of the population is concentrated in Popayán, the capital, followed by Santander de Quilichao and El Tambo with 6% and 3.4%, respectively. Likewise, 50.65% of the population are men and 49.35% women with a relative balance between both genders.</p>
