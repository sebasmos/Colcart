										<h3>Problematic</h3>
									<p> 75% of farmers in Colombia earn under the minimum wage, generating a
										low-life quality standard, particularly in rural areas, leading to a migratory process of these
										farmers towards the city and creating a decrease in job opportunities and more unemployed
										holders. It is also highlighted that 40% of the monthly family shopping basket comes from
										farmers.
										Secondly, there are high manufacturing costs for producing organic products. Moreover, people are not usually
										willing to pay for them at a fair price.
										Finally, from the 21 million potential lands for viable organic production, 1) only
										0.25% of it (54,000 hectares) are effectively agricultural dedicated and chemical free . Since
										nowadays there's an abundance of agrochemicals such as pesticides, fertilizers, and
										biochemicals for pests control, which lead to the pollution of water-supply sources and natural
										ecosystems that feed most of the food supply chain that we usually buy through intermediaries.</p>

										<h2>Why in the department of Cauca?</h2>
										<p>Although Cauca has been one of the most affected departments at a national level by violence caused by insurgent groups, drug traffickers and corrupt politicians, it has best managed to replace all of its effects. This department has the characteristic of having great wealth in all of its sectors including the economic, cultural and environmental ones. The city of Popayán, capital of the department of Cauca with a growth population of 10%, has been gaining recognition among Colombian visitors from abroad, not only for its religious traditions such as Holy Week and its Gastronomic Congress, but for it is the entrance to different tourist sites such as the National Archaeological Park from Tierradentro, National Park of Puracé and Historic Center of Popayán.

										<h2>Challenges of the food system in 2020 and in 2050
										</h2>
									<p>  Between 2009-2018 in the Cauca department, there has been an exponential increase from the farmers migration from rural areas towards urban areas due to social economic conditions and adversal causes triggered by the armed conflict in Colombia and creating at the same time illegal activities for easy ways to obtain money. This migration generates that 75% of farmers in Colombia earn under the minimum wage, 1) and thus generating a low-life quality standard, particularly in rural areas, and 2) creating a decrease in job opportunities and more unemployed holders. 3) It is also highlighted that 40% of the monthly family shopping basket comes from farmers

											In Cauca Department, not only its cultural diversity but its potential human resources for learning, will allow it to start agricultural processes that contribute to the economic growth of the region, improving the management of natural resources in order to implement productive processes that innovate in the search for sources of employment and promote entrepreneurship opportunities in the agricultural sector. Hence, this encourages and promotes healthy cropping practices with the environment and decreases the usage of fertilizers in the food supply chain, as well as the rescue of traditional and ancestral practices of our ancestors to produce organic-based products and thus enhancing the life-quality standards of producers and consumers

										<h2>How are we going to respond to this challenges?</h2>
										<p>
											Through Colcart, we will connect consumers with producers who manufacture certified organic-based products, that is, that do not contain chemical preservants, colourants, or fumigants, among others and therefore there will be fewer people affected regarding health impairments in the department of Cauca. Our solution forwards to an education training with the aim of giving organic cropping practices and commercial tools to the farmers, so they are able to potentiate and scale their business, reducing the  unemployment gaps in the cities by eliciting job opportunities in their own lands. The provided training we promote will endure the technical knowledge to farmers and will raise awareness about the importance of generating high-quality fruits, vegetables and organic products they produce and sell to their consumers, endorsed as well by national and international green seal certification based on ISO.

											Thus, 8% commision corresponds to $8. Finally the total earth 
											profit per month we would be getting is $8x70,000 families,
											which is $560,000.
											In this sense, we may consider the analysis per a smaller population, say only 
											1000 consumers per month. in this sense, the total revenue rounds 30,000 USD
											and therefore, more than 27,600 USD are earned amongst the farmers population, showing
											an increasing in a 160 per cent of their general revenue. This is mainly due to the 
											fact that most of intermediaries generaly increase the final product to up to three times
											the original price, leaving the farmers revenue with the lowest earnings despite of 
											being the main provider in the food supply chain.

										<h2>Economic Unit
										</h2>
									
										<p>
											To calculate the economic Unit we will consider the number 
											of clients using the web/mobile platform times the commission 
											for every sold product. For this, we have decided to take 8% commission. 
											It shall also be considered that according to the National Management Department of Statistics in Colombia (DANE),
											only in Popayan there are 70,000 families and each family spends $100 per family food basket.  We have encountered several 
											forms in order to understhat what ranges would our market segment be located considering some especific exclusion criteria,
											in particular, the economic relevance (people with medium to high economic adquisition), as well as age, highlighting our
											interest in the young population - due to its cognitive easy when regarding digital tools.

Also, it is necessary to consolidate economic sustainability processes that allow the improvement of the quality of life of existing populations and future generations, especially the most vulnerable, through cultural and nature community tourism, as a fundamental strategy for the responsible empowerment of the territory, based on the rescue of traditions, ancestral knowledge, the conservation of the environment, from the legacy to the new generations, in order for them to maintain them, appropriate them, and through them undertake life projects and can proudly show it to the visitors of the department..</p>

														The climate of the department of Cauca is determined by its geographical position and relief, presenting all the thermal floors from the super humid warmth of the Pacific coast to the perpetual snows of the snowy of Huila. Towards the patia basin, the clia is warm and semi-arid. On the central part the humid and semi humid temperate climate predominates and the cold climates are found on both sides of the Popayan plateau. The most frequent rains occur in the municipalities of Lopez, Timbiqui and Guapi with volumes of more than 7000 ml per year. During these seasons the climate is bimodal with a very hot season between June and August and rainy weather between October and December. In the spring, January-May, the rainfall decreases. The department of Cauca is crossed by two of the Andean mountain ranges, the central and the eastern. Also, you can find from mountainous zones to forests and plains like the plateau in which Popayan is located. Pacific plain, the western and central coordinates, the plateau in which the Colombian massif, the Patio Valley and a part of the Amazon are located.

														Caucasians have an unbalanced diet with excessive carbohydrate intake in relation to total caloric value and the proportion of people who consume fruits and vegetables is low in all age groups. In addition, there is a lack of knowledge on the part of the community in aspects and nutritional values of the food groups, difficulties for the generation of a culture of healthy and adequate nutritional habits for the physical and intellectual development of the inhabitants of the Cauca.
