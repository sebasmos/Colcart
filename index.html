									<h2>Our team</h2>
								<p>We are all Colombian students from the University of Cauca and have complemented our project 
									with students of different disciplines with the end of boosting integrity, inclusion and more
									 creativity in our project. Thus, we count with a greater amount of wisdom, experience in different 
									 topics such as entrepreneurship, leadership, programming, mathematics, software design, 
									 Internet of Things (IoT), polyglot language skills, business management wisdom and excellent 
									 public communication skills, among others. In this way we have created a multitalented

									<h2>Why</h2>
									<p>We would like to highlight that our aim is to generate a social impact by 
										boosting the farms social inclusion in the department of Cauca, because
										 we consider they must be paid what they deserve and we think we can empower 
										 them to become healthy products entrepreneurs of their own farms.
										  This will undoubtedly have a very positive social impact on the 
										  quality of life of this vulnerable population, which will have an 
										  impact on better health conditions as we as on ourselves, the general
										   population who daily consume their products.</p>

									<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
								<p> 75% of farmers in Colombia earn under the minimum wage, generating a
									low-life quality standard, particularly in rural areas, leading to a migratory process of these
									farmers towards the city and creating a decrease in job opportunities and more unemployed
									holders. It is also highlighted that 40% of the monthly family shopping basket comes from
									farmers.
									Secondly, there are high manufacturing costs for producing organic products. Moreover, people are not usually
									willing to pay for them at a fair price.
									Finally, from the 21 million potential lands for viable organic production, 1) only
									0.25% of it (54,000 hectares) are effectively agricultural dedicated and chemical free . Since
									nowadays there's an abundance of agrochemicals such as pesticides, fertilizers, and
									biochemicals for pests control, which lead to the pollution of water-supply sources and natural
									ecosystems that feed most of the food supply chain that we usually buy through intermediaries.</p>

								<h2>Review of the project</h2>
							<p> Colcart is a social startup that promotes the organic products market and the 
								 strengthening of farmers' work in the region through a web and mobile platform 
								 that connects producers and consumers in the department of Cauca. It will reduce 
								 intermediation costs, which generally reach 20% of the total benefit of the 
								 product, which will be used to increase the income of farmers and the creation 
								 of business and educational centers. Each product sold represents support 
								 for the work of farmers in a fair manner, sustainable development in the 
								 countryside and generating a positive impact on the environment by 
								 supporting chemical-free agricultural activities. Thanks to the fact 
								 that we have alliances such as the CRC, different farmers' organizations
								  will be able to meet, learn and make use of this platform to offer their 
								  different organic products to people, families, and businesses.
